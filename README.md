# Personal Nvim config

This config is based on kickstart.nvim with slight keymap changes and harpoon (Yes im a primeagen viewer but unironically love it)

I've been an vscode user for as long as i think and used vim on the command line on servers but never as a development tool, after seeing prime and teej developing the ssh coffe startup together i thought i should learn neovim. Im on mac for my professional life but on linux for private development. I dont have ripgrep or anything like that.
